About osgende
-------------

osgende is a Python-framework for creating customized Postgresql databases from
OSM data. Its philosophy is not to import the data directly from the OSM-XML
but instead it expects OSM data to have been imported into a Postgresql
database by Osmosis. This way it is also possible to support incremental
updates.

Requirements
------------

- Osmosis            http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis

    Needed for maintaining the full OSM database.
    You may also try the import script that ships with osgende, however, 
    consider this experimental.


- psycopg >= 2.3.0    http://initd.org/psycopg/
    
    Python bindings for PostgreSQL
    Please note that Debian still ships version 2.2.1 which does not yet
    have hstore support.

- Shapely             http://trac.gispython.org/lab/wiki/Shapely

    Python bindings for the geos library.
    (available as Debian package: python-shapely)


Usage
-----

Creating Databases
------------------

Osgende needs the Postgis and hstore extensions enabled. It also requires a set
of functions of its own, which can be found in contrib/osgende_func.sql.

Setting up Osmosis
------------------

osgende expects data to have been imported into a PostGIS Snapshot Schema.
No further geometry computations are required, osgende will do them by itself.

For example, you may import the Swiss extract from Geofabrik[1] like this:

  bzcat switzerland.osm.bz2 | osmosis --rx - --wp database=osm user=gis password=foo

In order to keep your database up-to-date you need to initialise the action script
first so that the *_changeset tables are filled appropriately. There is a script
in contrib/ which sets up Osmosis action function:

  psql -U gis -d osm -f contrib/osmosis_update_proc.sql
